#Payment Page
This is a simple PHP-based payment page that simulates a payment process. The user is asked to enter their name, card number, expiry date, CVV, and the amount they wish to pay. The form submission displays the entered payment details and confirms the success of the payment.

#Features
Countdown Timer: The page includes a 40-second countdown. If the user does not submit the form within this time, the form will disappear, and the timer will display "Time expired."
Payment Form: A form that captures the user's name, card details, and payment amount.
Payment Confirmation: After submission, the user's payment details (masked for security) are displayed, simulating a successful payment.
Prerequisites
A web server with PHP support (e.g., Apache or Nginx).
A browser to view the page.
#How It Works
When the page is loaded, a 40-second countdown begins.
The user fills out their payment details in the provided form.
Upon submission, the page displays a confirmation message and shows the entered details.
The card number is partially masked for security (only the last 4 digits are shown).
If the countdown timer reaches zero before submission, the form disappears and shows "Time expired."
Installation & Usage
Clone the repository or copy the code into a .php file:

@bash
Copy code
Place the .php file into your web server's document root (e.g., htdocs for XAMPP or www for WAMP/LAMP).

#Open the PHP file in your browser:

bash
Copy code
http://localhost/payment.php
Fill in the payment details and submit the form.

#Files
payment.php: The main PHP file that contains the payment form and backend logic.
Code Breakdown
HTML: Provides the form structure and layout for the payment page.
PHP: Handles form submission, processes the payment details, and displays a confirmation message.
JavaScript: Manages the 40-second countdown timer.
#Form Fields
Name: The name of the cardholder.
Card Number: A simulated card number input.
Expiry Date: The expiry date of the card.
CVV: A 3-digit security code.
Amount: The amount the user wishes to pay.
#Notes
This example does not include real payment processing; it simulates the payment flow. In a production environment, you would need to integrate with a real payment gateway such as Stripe, PayPal, or others.
